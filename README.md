### Installation

*Note:* using GNU stow
 
- Clone the repo into $HOME: `$ git clone git@github.com:rcat/.dots.git`
 
- `$ cd .dots`
 
- `$ stow <package-name> [-t <target-directory>]`
 
*Note:* By default stow installs packages into the parent of its directory (or current directory). Some packages like gsimplecal, gtk3, i3, i3status, tilix should be placed into $HOME/.config/ .
