# List of plugin names to load on startup
# Plugins that implement only one effect are normally auto-loaded and do not need
# to be specified here. This is useful mostly for loading multi-effect plugins.
plugins: [lua]
# Additional paths to search plugins in. Similar to -m option on command line.
# plugin-paths: []

# Generic key groups, available to all profiles
groups:
    special: [game, light]
    functions: [F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12]
    functions-extra: [sysrq, scrolllock, pause]
    alpha: [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m,
            n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z]
    modifiers: [lctrl, rctrl, lshift, rshift, lmeta, lalt, ralt, capslock, fn, compose]
    arrows: [left, right, up, down]

# Effects define a named set of plugins for use in profiles.
# Effects are rendered in order, so effects down the list can see and/or
# overwrite whatever was rendered by effects higher in the list.
#
# Anytime a color is specified, it can be either:
#   - a 6-digit RGB hexadecimal color, web-style. Eg: ffff00 is yellow.
#   - an 8-digit RGBA hexadecimal color. Last two digits specify transparency,
#     from 00 (transparent) to ff (opaque).
#   - a color name, from CSS web color names. Those are always fully opaque.
#
# Note that there is no buffer clear in between renders. So to avoid odd
# flickering, every key should be written to by at least one plugin.
# If that is an issue, simply start with the fill plugin, setting all keys
# to opaque black or some other color.

# Profiles trigger effect activation when their lookup matches
# Their name doesn't matter, but order does, as when several profiles match
# the last matching wins.
#
# Only one profile can be active at any time. A profile with no lookup
# or default setting is always active. Lookups use regular expression. They
# must match fully (as if they were automatically enclosed in ^$).
#
profiles:
    __default__:                    # Special name __default__ is active when no other profile matches
